I will curate a list of good educational resources and include code samples as I see necessary:

## What is Java?

Java is an object oriented programming language that runs exlcusively on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The JVM can be installed on most any device and you will need to install the Java Development Kit (JDK) in order to get started. (Here is the link to install JDK 1.8)[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html]. Be careful not to install any extra toolbars or McAfee nonsense.

**Stick to Java 8 if possible**

##Java Basics

* http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/

This is a very gentle and thorough introduction to the basics of programming and Java. Many exercises will be too easy for the typical Prime graduate but when learning a new technology starting simple is advided. This does not require any particular IDE or strange library. Just straight Java.

* http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/

Hideously dry and boring but it has a lot of academic value.

A free guided video lecture.

Classic codecademy. This tutorial does not ask you to install Java or setup an IDE which is not ideal for doing any real programming.

## IDE

If you're coming to Java for the first time then an IDE might be new to you. An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) Is basically a glorified text editor that may include build automation tools, debugger, intelligent code completion, source control integration, and many other features besides just a source code editor. Think of it as an all-in-one development suite (rather then editing your code in an editor and then running from the terminal or using other tools). Most of the Java ecosystem is centered around IDE development, although, they are not strictly necessary.
 
There are three main IDEs to which I am familiar.

1. Intellij

This has become the standard IDE since the fall of Eclipse. It does cost money but there is free version that should do for most personal projects. (Here is a setup tutorial)[https://examples.javacodegeeks.com/desktop-java/ide/intellij-idea-tutorial-beginners/].

2. Eclipse

Still a very popular IDE but it's in decline. Every version seems to get worse. It will probably be fine for the 30 day challenge but you may problems as your projects become more advanced. (Here is a setup tutorial)[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/eclipse/eclipse_installation.htm]. Let me know if you have trouble with that tutorial. Eclipse is notorious for having outdated and nonsense tutorials for every feature and addon.

3. Netbeans

This IDE has been neglected for a long time. (Recently Apache adopted it into it's community)[https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/NetBeansProposal]. So it may improve in the near future. Not recommended for this challenge.

If none of the above interest you then don't be afraid to stick to your trusty text editor + terminal. It should be fine for the purposes of this challenge.

## Spring
